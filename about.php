	   	<p>Hello everyone!</p>

		<p>I greatly appreciate the time you've taken to visit my page and view my photography. I have always been artistic in some shape or form. My interest in photography started right around when digital photography was coming out back around 2002-2003.</p>
		
		<p>In High School I took a black and white film class which was extremely fun. We learned how to roll and unroll our own films and process them. </p>
		
		<p>Right after I graduated in 2003 Canon came out with their first DSLR and a whole new world was open to me! My father bought the camera for my mom but really it ended up being mine. I brought it to college with me in Rexburg, ID where I caught some AMAZING shots both on the ground and on horseback!</p>
		
		<p>My specialty and focus are Pets, Equines and Nature. Not only because of my love for them all but because I believe our pets and equines are family too!</p>
